browsertrix-crawler is for kids.

this is an (experimental) set of config files, scripts, etc. for [browsertrix crawler](https://crawler.docs.browsertrix.com/) for automated, high fidelity web archiving.

this presumes that you've got some passing familarity with the [user guide](https://crawler.docs.browsertrix.com/user-guide/) and access to Docker. the [SUCHO-specific browsertrix documentation](https://www.sucho.org/browsertrix) is also helpful.

## todos

* [x] crawl config for exhibits.lib.b.e
* [ ] investigate drivers for osd viewer (see [edsu's blog post](https://inkdroid.org/2022/09/12/driver/))
